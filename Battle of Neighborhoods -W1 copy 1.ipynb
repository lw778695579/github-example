Base on thess study, we can almost make a conclusion that running a restaurant business maybe a good idea. \n\nBut opening a restaurant requires juggling many moving parts and can feel like a difficult undertaking. One of the key task is finding a good Location and understand the competition of that area. Some nearby competition can help with marketing. But it\u2019s wise to have enough of a distance that you can still guarantee a solid pool of customers who won\u2019t be easily drawn to another similar place. So how should we decide the right location to open a **high class** Chinese restaurant in the **Toronto city area** ? ",

The **Foursquare data**(explore top 10 venues in each Toronto neighborhood) will also be used to explore the current Toronto restaurant locations to quickly understand where are those **major competitors**. \n\nAlthrough we narrow down the target location to a short-list neighborhoods, it is still need to discuss which one is the best to set up the stakeholder  restaurant. However, this data science project will give us a good starting point and allows the stakeholder to do the further ground survey.\n\nFrom the data availability point of view, if we can have kind of data describe what are those favorite Chinese dishes Canadian like to eat will give us a further help to design the restaurant dish menu.",
